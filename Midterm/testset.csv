0,"How should equitable outcomes be ensured in automated systems, particularly in relation to underserved communities?","["" \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHUMAN ALTERNATIVES, \nCONSIDERATION, AND \nFALLBACK \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nEquitable. Consideration should be given to ensuring outcomes of the fallback and escalation system are \nequitable when compared to those of the automated system and such that the fallback and escalation \nsystem provides equitable access to underserved communities.105 \nTimely. Human consideration and fallback are only useful if they are conducted and concluded in a \ntimely manner. The determination of what is timely should be made relative to the specific automated \nsystem, and the review system should be staffed and regularly assessed to ensure it is providing timely \nconsideration and fallback. In time-critical systems, this mechanism should be immediately available or, \nwhere possible, available before the harm occurs. Time-critical systems include, but are not limited to, \nvoting-related systems, automated building access and other access systems, systems that form a critical \ncomponent of healthcare, and systems that have the ability to withhold wages or otherwise cause \nimmediate financial penalties. \nEffective. The organizational structure surrounding processes for consideration and fallback should \nbe designed so that if the human decision-maker charged with reassessing a decision determines that it \nshould be overruled, the new decision will be effectively enacted. This includes ensuring that the new \ndecision is entered into the automated system throughout its components, any previous repercussions from \nthe old decision are also overturned, and safeguards are put in place to help ensure that future decisions do \nnot result in the same errors. \nMaintained. The human consideration and fallback process and any associated automated processes \nshould be maintained and supported as long as the relevant automated system continues to be in use. \nInstitute training, assessment, and oversight to combat automation bias and ensure any \nhuman-based components of a system are effective. \nTraining and assessment. Anyone administering, interacting with, or interpreting the outputs of an auto\xad\nmated system should receive training in that system, including how to properly interpret outputs of a system \nin light of its intended purpose and in how to mitigate the effects of automation bias. The training should reoc\xad\ncur regularly to ensure it is up to date with the system and to ensure the system is used appropriately. Assess\xad\nment should be ongoing to ensure that the use of the system with human involvement provides for appropri\xad\nate results, i.e., that the involvement of people does not invalidate the system's assessment as safe and effective \nor lead to algorithmic discrimination. \nOversight. Human-based systems have the potential for bias, including automation bias, as well as other \nconcerns that may limit their effectiveness. The results of assessments of the efficacy and potential bias of \nsuch human-based systems should be overseen by governance structures that have the potential to update the \noperation of the human-based system in order to mitigate these effects. \n50\n""]","Equitable outcomes in automated systems, especially in relation to underserved communities, should be ensured by designing fallback and escalation systems that provide equitable access to these communities.

2,What are the key privacy protections provided by the Privacy Act of 1974 for personal information in federal records systems?,"[' \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDATA PRIVACY \nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE\nReal-life examples of how these principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practical \ntechnical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \nThe Privacy Act of 1974 requires privacy protections for personal information in federal \nrecords systems, including limits on data retention, and also provides individuals a general \nright to access and correct their data. Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is “relevant and necessary” to \naccomplish an agency’s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\xad\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. \nFurther, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \ncomply with the Privacy Act’s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \ncorrect an individual’s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual’s “qualifications, character, rights, … \nopportunities…, or benefits.” \nNIST’s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \norganizations to manage privacy risks. The NIST Framework gives organizations ways to identify and \ncommunicate their privacy risks and goals to support ethical decision-making in system, product, and service \ndesign or deployment, as well as the measures they are taking to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws \nor regulations. It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\nA school board’s attempt to surveil public school students—undertaken without \nadequate community input—sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state’s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \n“biometric identifying technology” in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools. \nFederal law requires employers, and any consultants they may retain, to report the costs \nof surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute, providing a transparency \nmechanism to help protect worker organizing. Employers engaging in workplace surveillance ""where \nan object there-of, directly or indirectly, is […] to obtain information concerning the activities of employees or a \nlabor organization in connection with a labor dispute"" must report expenditures relating to this surveillance to \nthe Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards, and consultants who employers retain for \nthese purposes must also file reports regarding their activities.81\nPrivacy choices on smartphones show that when technologies are well designed, privacy \nand data agency can be meaningful and not overwhelming. These choices—such as contextual, timely \nalerts about location tracking—are brief, direct, and use-specific. Many of the expectations listed here for \nprivacy by design and use-specific consent mirror those distributed to developers as best practices when \ndeveloping for smart phone devices,82 such as being transparent about how user data will be used, asking for app \npermissions during their use so that the use-context will be clear to users, and ensuring that the app will still \nwork if users deny (or later revoke) some permissions. \n39\n']","The Privacy Act of 1974 provides privacy protections for personal information in federal records systems by imposing limits on data retention, granting individuals the right to access and correct their data.

The American public should be protect\xad\ned via built-in privacy protections, data minimization, use and collection limitations, and transparency, in addition \nto being entitled to clear mechanisms to control access to and use of their data—including their metadata—in a \nproactive, informed, and ongoing way. Any automated system collecting, using, sharing, or storing personal data \nshould meet these expectations. \nProtect privacy by design and by default \nPrivacy by design and by default. Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect\xad\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks \nfrom reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This \nincludes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by \ninferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms. Data \ncollection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected. Data should \nonly be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and \nuse is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected. User experience \nresearch should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and \nhow it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires. \nData collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \nnarrow identified goals, to avoid ""mission creep.""  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be \nstrictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on \nthese identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for \nnew privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. \nClear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance \nwith legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\xad\nfied. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should \nattempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\xad\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks \noutweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not \ninclude sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not \nreasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow \nprivacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific \nconsented use case. Best practices could include using privacy-enhancing cryptography or other types of \nprivacy-enhancing technologies or fine-grained permissions and access control mechanisms, along with \nconventional system security protocols. \n33\n', ' \n \n \n \n \n \nDATA PRIVACY \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nData access and correction.

Entities designing, developing, and deploying automated systems should \nestablish and maintain the capabilities that will allow individuals to use their own automated systems to help \nthem make consent, access, and control decisions in a complex data ecosystem.

When members of the public wish to know what data about them is being used in a system, the \nentity responsible for the development of the system should respond quickly with a report on the data it has \ncollected or stored about them. Such a report should be machine-readable, understandable by most users, and \ninclude, to the greatest extent allowable under law, any data and metadata about them or collected from them, \nwhen and how their data and metadata were collected, the specific ways that data or metadata are being used, \nwho has access to their data and metadata, and what time limitations apply to these data. In cases where a user \nlogin is not available, identity verification may need to be performed before providing such a report to ensure \nuser privacy. Additionally, summary reporting should be proactively made public with general information \nabout how peoples’ data and metadata is used, accessed, and stored. Summary reporting should include the \nresults of any surveillance pre-deployment assessment, including disparity assessment in the real-world \ndeployment context, the specific identified goals of any data collection, and the assessment done to ensure \nonly the minimum required data is collected. It should also include documentation about the scope limit \nassessments, including data retention timelines and associated justification, and an assessment of the \nimpact of surveillance or data collection on rights, opportunities, and access.

8,What is the phenomenon of confabulation in GAI systems and how can it impact real-world applications like healthcare?,"[' \n6 \n2.2. Confabulation \n“Confabulation” refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and conﬁdently present \nerroneous or false content in response to prompts. Confabulations also include generated outputs that \ndiverge from the prompts or other input or that contradict previously generated statements in the same \ncontext. These phenomena are colloquially also referred to as “hallucinations” or “fabrications.” \nConfabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts.9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the \nway generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution \nof their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While \nsuch statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce \noutputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when \nit comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly \ncontextual and/or domain expertise.  \nRisks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content – often due to the conﬁdent nature \nof the response – leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for \nmany real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \ninformation reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong \ntreatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI \ninto applications involving consequential decision making. \nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the \nsystem’s answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system’s output. \nFor instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the \nanswer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, \npotentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human. \nThe extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the \npotential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study. Given the wide \nrange of downstream impacts of GAI, it is diﬃcult to estimate the downstream scale and impact of \nconfabulations. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Explainable \nand Interpretable \n2.3. Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content \nGAI systems can produce content that is inciting, radicalizing, or threatening, or that gloriﬁes violence, \nwith greater ease and scale than other technologies. LLMs have been reported to generate dangerous or \nviolent recommendations, and some models have generated actionable instructions for dangerous or \n \n \n9 Confabulations of falsehoods are most commonly a problem for text-based outputs; for audio, image, or video \ncontent, creative generation of non-factual content can be a desired behavior.  \n10 For example, legal confabulations have been shown to be pervasive in current state-of-the-art LLMs. See also, \ne.g.,  \n']","Confabulation in GAI systems refers to the generation of erroneous or false content in response to prompts, including outputs that diverge from the input or contradict previous statements.

9,How can provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection mechanisms help in GAI risk management efforts?,"[' \n51 \ngeneral public participants. For example, expert AI red-teamers could modify or verify the \nprompts written by general public AI red-teamers. These approaches may also expand coverage \nof the AI risk attack surface.  \n• \nHuman / AI: Performed by GAI in combination with specialist or non-specialist human teams. \nGAI-led red-teaming can be more cost eﬀective than human red-teamers alone. Human or GAI-\nled AI red-teaming may be better suited for eliciting diﬀerent types of harms. \n \nA.1.6. Content Provenance \nOverview \nGAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. \nSome aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to \ndistinguish human-generated content from AI-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate \nthese risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and \nhistory of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater \ninformation access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of \ntrustworthiness in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, \ndigital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their \nsource, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust. Provenance data tracking and synthetic \ncontent detection mechanisms provide information about the origin and history of content to assist in \nGAI risk management eﬀorts. \nProvenance metadata can include information about GAI model developers or creators of GAI content, \ndate/time of creation, location, modiﬁcations, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, \nvideos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can \nhelp assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital \ncontent. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, \nmetadata recording, digital ﬁngerprinting, and human authentication, among others. \nProvenance Data Tracking Approaches \nProvenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data \ninputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for \ndigital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata \nas well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin \nand history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data \ntracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or \ncontrol over the various trade-oﬀs and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream \nperformance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize \nrobustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational \ncomplexity (the resources required to implement watermarking).

Systems should be \ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\xad\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\xad\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\xad\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\xad\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\xad\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\xad\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \njustification for any continued use of the system. \nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \nthe disparity may be required by law. \nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\xad\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\xad\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \nresults is occurring.

Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \n26\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n']","Stakeholders can prevent algorithmic discrimination in automated systems by taking proactive and continuous measures to protect individuals and communities from unjust treatment based on race, color, ethnicity, sex, religion, age, disability, and other protected classifications.

14,How can automated systems address disparities and prevent algorithmic discrimination?,"["" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nEnsuring accessibility during design, development, and deployment. Systems should be \ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\xad\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\xad\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\xad\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\xad\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\xad\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\xad\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \njustification for any continued use of the system. \nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \nthe disparity may be required by law. \nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\xad\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\xad\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \nmore frequently.

Designers, developers, \nand deployers of automated systems should take proactive and \ncontinuous measures to protect individuals and communities \nfrom algorithmic discrimination and to use and design systems in \nan equitable way.  This protection should include proactive equity \nassessments as part of the system design, use of representative data \nand protection against proxies for demographic features, ensuring \naccessibility for people with disabilities in design and development, \npre-deployment and ongoing disparity testing and mitigation, and \nclear organizational oversight. Independent evaluation and plain \nlanguage reporting in the form of an algorithmic impact assessment, \nincluding disparity testing results and mitigation information, \nshould be performed and made public whenever possible to confirm \nthese protections.\n23\n', ' \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nAny automated system should be tested to help ensure it is free from algorithmic discrimination before it can be \nsold or used. Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \n26\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n']","Stakeholders can ensure equity in automated systems by conducting proactive equity assessments in the design phase, using representative and robust data, guarding against proxies for demographic features, and performing ongoing disparity testing and mitigation.
