        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model (such as GPT-3 or BERT) uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response on its own. By leveraging external knowledge sources, RAG can significantly enhance the performance of language models in tasks such as question answering, dialogue systems, and information retrieval.'"

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database based on the input query. The retrieval component typically uses techniques from information retrieval, such as TF-IDF, BM25, or more advanced neural retrieval models.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents or information are then used to augment the input query. This means that the input query is enriched with additional context or knowledge that is relevant to the query.\\n\\n3. **Generation Component**: The augmented input is then fed into a generation model, usually a transformer-based language model like GPT-3. The generation model uses the augmented input to produce a more accurate and contextually relevant response.\\n\\n### Key Benefits of RAG Systems:\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By incorporating relevant information retrieved from a large corpus, the system can generate responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate.\\n- **Knowledge Integration**: The system can integrate external knowledge into the generation process, making it more knowledgeable and capable of answering a wider range of questions.\\n- **Flexibility**: RAG systems can be applied to various tasks, including question answering, summarization, and conversational agents.\\n\\n### Example Use Case:\\nImagine a RAG system designed for a customer support chatbot. When a user asks a question, the retrieval component first searches the company's knowledge base for relevant documents. These documents are then used to augment the user's query, providing additional context. The generation component then uses this augmented query to generate a detailed and accurate response to the user's question.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems leverage the strengths of both retrieval and generation techniques to produce high-quality, contextually relevant text.\",\n",

This is crucial for large-scale models where computational resources can be a limiting factor.\\n\\n2. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA focuses on parameter-efficient methods, reducing the number of parameters that need to be adjusted during training. This leads to faster training times and lower memory requirements.\\n\\n3. **Performance Gains**: LoRA has been shown to improve the performance of models significantly. For instance, training with different LoRA ranks can unlock higher performance levels, almost doubling the difference between the base model and lower-rank LoRA configurations.\\n\\n4. **QLoRA**: An even more efficient variant of LoRA, known as QLoRA, further enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the adaptation process.\\n\\n5. **Parallelization**: Systems like the Punica kernel design consolidate the batching of requests for unique LoRA models, improving performance by parallelizing feature-weight multiplication of different requests in a batch.\\n\\n6. **Model Storage**: Techniques like SGMV (Single GPU Multi-View) allow a GPU to store only a single copy of the pre-trained model while serving different LoRA models, optimizing storage and computational efficiency.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a popular and effective technique for fine-tuning large language models, especially in open-source environments.',\n",
